        It's an approach to brand strategy that starts from a relational,
        collaborative place. Rather than a quick fix mentality, we want to work
        alongside your startup, existing business, or new idea in order to help
        you build a strong core identity and reach the right people.

      <p>
        Renga is a type of Japanese poetry in which two or more poets alternate
        back and forth in the composition of a single poem. In this ancient art
        form, every part matters to the direction of the whole. What came before
        is as valuable of what is still to come.
      </p>

        This heart of messy collaboration captures our creative approach - which
        is why weâ€™ve chose to adopt it as our name. Together, we build upon the
        work you have already done and then give you something to keep building
        on top of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because every brand is unique, we treat each client as a new
        collaborative possibility, working alongside you to make something
        special.
