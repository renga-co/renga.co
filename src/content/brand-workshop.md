      Matt & Jared from Renga were honest, open and very knowledgeable about the branding and marketing of my creative business. They helped me to communicate my passions more effectively and coherently, so I could narrow in on my goals. I left the initial workshop feeling excited and inspired. They helped me to communicate my 'why' more clearly and helped to shift the focus of my business idea to mirror my passions.
