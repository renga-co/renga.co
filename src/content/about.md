Our founder, Jared, launched his first company in 2009. In the midst of gaining the practical experience of running a startup, he found himself having all sorts of exciting conversations with his peers around their own creative ideas and offering his help in getting them started. Although he eventually decided to close this first business, Jared discovered that what he loved more than anything else was collaborating with others to help their ideas succeed.

After a few years working in the digital marketing world at some incredible companies, such as Shopify and Bluesound, as well as launching several other smaller business ventures, Jared finally decided to step out and pursue his dream of building his own creative agency. So, in 2017, Renga was born.

Renga is a type of Japanese poetry in which two or more poets alternate back and forth in the composition of a single poem. In this ancient art form, every part matters to the direction of the whole. What came before is as valuable of what is still to come.  

This heart of messy collaboration captures our creative approach - which is why weâ€™ve chose to adopt it as our name. Together, we build upon the work you have already done and then give you something to keep building on top of that. Because every brand is unique, we treat each client as a new collaborative possibility, working alongside you to make something special.
